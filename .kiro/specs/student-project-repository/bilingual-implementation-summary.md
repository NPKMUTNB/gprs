## Overview
Task 32 "Add bilingual support" has been successfully implemented. The system now supports both English and Thai languages with a language switcher in the navigation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Language Files Created (Subtask 32.1)

#### English Language File
- **File**: `lang/en/messages.php`
- **Content**: Comprehensive translations for all common UI elements including:
  - Navigation items (Dashboard, Projects, Users, etc.)
  - Common actions (Create, Edit, Delete, Save, etc.)
  - Project-related terms (Title, Abstract, Status, etc.)
  - Status labels (Draft, Submitted, Approved, etc.)
  - File management terms
  - Evaluation terms
  - User management terms
  - Search and filter labels
  - Success/error messages
  - Confirmation messages
  - Report labels
  - And more...

#### Thai Language File
- **File**: `lang/th/messages.php`
- **Content**: Complete Thai translations for all English terms
- All UI elements have been translated to Thai

### 2. Views Updated with Translations (Subtask 32.2)

#### Navigation (resources/views/layouts/navigation.blade.php)
- ✅ Added language switcher dropdown in the main navigation
- ✅ Added language switcher in responsive mobile menu
- ✅ Updated all navigation links to use `__('messages.key')` helper
- ✅ Language switcher shows current language with flag icons (🇬🇧 🇹🇭)
- ✅ Supports both desktop and mobile views

#### Projects Index View (resources/views/projects/index.blade.php)
- ✅ Page title and "Create Project" button
- ✅ Search bar label and placeholder
- ✅ All filter labels (Category, Year, Semester, Advisor, Status)
- ✅ Filter dropdown options (All Categories, All Years, etc.)
- ✅ Status options (Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected, Completed)
- ✅ Action buttons (Filter, Cancel)
- ✅ Results count message
- ✅ "No projects found" message

#### Student Dashboard (resources/views/dashboard/partials/student.blade.php)
- ✅ Quick stats labels (Projects, Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected)
- ✅ Quick Actions section title
- ✅ Action buttons (Create Project, Browse Projects)
- ✅ "My Projects" section title

### 3. Language Switching Functionality

#### Route
- **Route**: `/locale/{locale}` (already existed in routes/web.php)
- **Name**: `locale.switch`
- **Supported locales**: `en`, `th`
- **Behavior**: Stores selected language in session and redirects back

#### Middleware
- **File**: `app/Http/Middleware/SetLocale.php` (already existed)
- **Functionality**: Automatically sets application locale based on session value

## How to Use

### For Users
1. Click the language dropdown in the navigation bar (shows current language)
2. Select either "🇬🇧 English" or "🇹🇭 Thai"
3. The page will reload with the selected language
4. Language preference is stored in the session

### For Developers
To add translations to new views:

```blade
{{-- Instead of hardcoded text --}}
<h1>Projects</h1>

{{-- Use the translation helper --}}
<h1>{{ __('messages.projects') }}</h1>
```

To add new translation keys:
1. Add the key to `lang/en/messages.php`
2. Add the corresponding Thai translation to `lang/th/messages.php`
3. Use `__('messages.your_key')` in your views

## Translation Coverage

The following areas have been translated:
- ✅ Navigation menu
- ✅ Projects listing page
- ✅ Student dashboard
- ✅ Common UI elements (buttons, labels, messages)
- ⚠️ Other views (auth, project create/edit, evaluations, etc.) still need translation updates

## Next Steps

To complete full bilingual support across the application:
1. Update remaining views to use translation helpers:
   - Authentication views (login, register)
   - Project create/edit forms
   - Evaluation forms
   - Admin pages (users, categories, tags)
   - Report pages
   - Profile pages
   - Error pages
2. Update flash messages in controllers to use translations
3. Update validation messages to use translations
4. Test all pages in both languages

## Files Modified

1. `lang/en/messages.php` - Created
2. `lang/th/messages.php` - Created
3. `resources/views/layouts/navigation.blade.php` - Updated
4. `resources/views/projects/index.blade.php` - Updated
5. `resources/views/dashboard/partials/student.blade.php` - Updated

## Testing

To test the bilingual support:
1. Start the Laravel development server
2. Navigate to any page
3. Click the language switcher in the navigation
4. Verify that text changes between English and Thai
5. Check that the language preference persists across page navigation

## Notes

- The language switcher uses flag emojis (🇬🇧 🇹🇭) for visual identification
- The current language is displayed in the dropdown trigger
- Language preference is session-based (not stored in database)
- All translation keys are prefixed with `messages.` for organization
- The implementation follows Laravel's localization best practices
